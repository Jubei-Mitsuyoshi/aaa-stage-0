 How to install execline

Like any other piece of software (and information generally), execline comes with NO WARRANTY.

Starting with release 1.1.0, execline is available under the terms of the ISC license, see the included package/COPYING file.
Requirements
System

    A Unix-like system

Build-time

    A standard C development environment
    The skalibs package, version 1.4.2 or higher

Run-time

Depending on the way you compile and link execline:

    No dependencies (static executables)
    or a standard C run-time environment (dynamic executables with flag-allstatic)
    or a standard C run-time environment, and the skalibs package, version 1.4.2 or higher (dynamic executables without flag-allstatic)

Installation

execline is best used with the slashpackage convention, but it is not a hard requirement.

    Create a /package directory:

         mkdir -p /package
         chmod 1755 /package
         cd /package

    (If you are not following the slashpackage convention, you can use any temporary build directory instead.)
    Download the latest version of execline, execline-1.3.0.tar.gz, into /package.
    Unpack the execline package:

         tar -zxpvf execline-1.3.0.tar.gz
         # if you do not have GNU tar, check with your gunzip and tar manual pages.
         rm execline-1.3.0.tar.gz
         cd admin/execline-1.3.0

    Configure the package by editing the files in conf-compile/ following these instructions. The execline package also supports this list of flags.
    Compile and set up execline:

         make
         sudo make install

    The compilation and installation processes are detailed here.
    To save disk space:

         make clean

    (If you are not following the slashpackage convention, you can use any temporary build directory instead.)
    Download the latest version of s6-dns, s6-dns-0.0.2.tar.gz, into /package.
    Unpack the s6-dns package:

         tar -zxpvf s6-dns-0.0.2.tar.gz
         # if you do not have GNU tar, check with your gunzip and tar manual pages.
         rm s6-dns-0.0.2.tar.gz
         cd web/s6-dns-0.0.2

    Configure the package by editing the files in conf-compile/ following these instructions. The s6-dns package supports this list of flags.

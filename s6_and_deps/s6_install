Requirements
System

    A Unix-like system

Build-time

    A standard C development environment
    The skalibs package, version 1.4.2 or higher
    The execline package, version 1.2.4 or higher

Run-time

Depending on the way you compile and link s6:

    No dependencies (static executables)
    or a standard C run-time environment (dynamic executables with flag-allstatic)
    or a standard C run-time environment, the execline package, version 1.2.4 or higher, and the skalibs package, version 1.4.2 or higher (dynamic executables without flag-allstatic)

Installation

s6 is best used with the slashpackage convention, but it is not a hard requirement.

    Create a /package directory:

         mkdir -p /package
         chmod 1755 /package
         cd /package

    (If you are not following the slashpackage convention, you can use any temporary build directory instead.)
    Download the latest version of s6, s6-1.1.1.tar.gz, into /package.
    Unpack the s6 package:

         tar -zxpvf s6-1.1.1.tar.gz
         # if you do not have GNU tar, check with your gunzip and tar manual pages.
         rm s6-1.1.1.tar.gz
         cd admin/s6-1.1.1

    Configure the package by editing the files in conf-compile/ following these instructions. The s6 package also supports this list of flags.
    Compile and set up s6:

         make
         sudo make install

    The compilation and installation processes are detailed here.
    To save disk space:

         make clean

    (If you are not following the slashpackage convention, you can use any temporary build directory instead.)
    Download the latest version of s6-portable-utils, s6-portable-utils-1.0.2.tar.gz, into /package.
    Unpack the s6-portable-utils package:

         tar -zxpvf s6-portable-utils-1.0.2.tar.gz
         # if you do not have GNU tar, check with your gunzip and tar manual pages.
         rm s6-portable-utils-1.0.2.tar.gz
         cd admin/s6-portable-utils-1.0.2

    Configure the package by editing the files in conf-compile/ following these instructions. s6-portable-utils currently does not support other flags than flag-allstatic and flag-slashpackage.

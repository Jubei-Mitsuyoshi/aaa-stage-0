bilibop (0.4.20) unstable; urgency=low

  * bilibop-common:
  * Modify common.sh: replace '/sbin/udevadm' by just 'udevadm', and declare a
    udevadm() function if the command itself is not in the PATH. This should
    work with all versions of udev.
  * Modify device_node_from_major_minor(): rely on the contents of /dev/block
    (as these symlinks are not created by udev).
  * Modify drivemap.sh: add a missing debug command at the beginning of a
    function.
  * Modify lib/bilibop/disk: set -e
  * Fix a typo in drivemap.sh and the drivemap command: rename function
    _drivemap_max_mp_lenght() -> _drivemap_max_mp_length(), and also fix the
    same spelling error for the variable lenght -> length.
  * Update bilibop(7) and bilibop.conf(5) manpages (and also the french
    translations).
  * Update documentation (README.Debian, examples/bilibop.conf, misc/*.txt).

  * bilibop-rules:
  * Add translations for the debconf templates:
    + Italian: thanks to Beatrice Torracca <beatricet@libero.it>
      Closes: #727755.
    + Portuguese: thanks to Am√©rico Monteiro <a_monteiro@gmx.com>
      Closes: #730000.
  * Modify the config maintscript and the initramfs script: as the --run
    option no more works for 'udevadm info', use the hardcoded /run/udev
    instead.
  * Modify the udev rules file: rely on the 'removable' attribute to know that
    a device is a disk (as for the 'partition' attribute to know that a device
    is a partition); also do not set unconditionally Udisks ENV variables for
    the disk; reorder some rules, rename LABELs, + other cosmetics.
  * Update bilibop_rules_generator helper script for consistency.
  * Fix management of errors in physical_volumes_filter and pvfilter.sh
  * Remove a reference to a non-existent manpage in pvfilter.sh
  * Fix a spelling error in the help page of physical_volumes_filter.
  * Modify _pvfilter_find_dev_links(): use a best 'find' commandline, and
    simplify its output filter (grep).
  * Modify postinst to regenerate the cache file if the filter value has been
    modified in lvm.conf
  * Add support for the LVM 'global_filter' variable (lvm2 >= 2.02.98):
    + Add '_pvfilter_has_global()' function in pvfilter.sh: just tests if the
      'global_filter' variable is supported by the version of lvm2 actually
      installed on the system.
    + Modify _pvfilter_init_lvm_configfile().
    + Modify _pvfilter_init_device_filters().
    + Add --global and --noglobal options to the helper script.
    + Rename debconf template: 'bilibop-rules/physical_volumes_filter/warning'
      -> 'bilibop-rules/physical_volumes_filter/without_global_filter/warning'
    + Add 'bilibop-rules/physical_volumes_filter/with_global_filter/warning'
      debconf template.
    + Update maintscripts.
  * Add support for Udisks 2.x (udisks2 package):
    + Modify the udev rules file to set udisks2 variables as well as udisks
      variables.
    + Update bilibop_rules_generator helper script for consistency.
    + Modify lsbilibop script: grep also udisks2 variables.
  * Replace all occurences of 'eval ${foo}' by [ "${foo}" = "true" ] (as eval
    ${foo} is true if ${foo} is empty).
  * Replace all occurences of '\s' by the POSIX class '[[:blank:]]' in grep
    commands (see bug #729581/#730146).
  * Update lsbilibop(8) manpage (and also the french translation).
  * Update documentation (README.Debian, examples/bilibop.conf).

  * bilibop-lockfs:
  * Add 'random' as a possible value for BILIBOP_LOCKFS_SWAP_POLICY: this
    allows one to specify to use a swap device only if it is encrypted with a
    random key.
    + Add new function is_randomly_encrypted() in lockfs.sh
    + Modify get_swap_policy() and apply_swap_policy() in lockfs.sh
  * Add a new boot option 'lockfs=default', used to reset bilibop-lockfs
    variables to their default values, i.e. empty strings (but BILIBOP_LOCKFS
    itself, which is then set to 'true'); modify lockfs_mount_helper and the
    initramfs scripts accordingly.
  * Modify lockfs_mount_helper and local-bottom initramfs script to also
    accept boot options of the form 'lockfs=-/foobar', where /foobar is a
    mountpoint to whitelist.
  * Remove unneeded code about 'crypto_LUKS' filesystem types in the mount
    helper script: the mount.crypt command (libpam-mount) already manages
    permissions of children virtual devices (loop and dm) when the 'ro' option
    is encountered in the fstab entry.
  * Add new function get_device_node() in lockfs.sh: if LABEL=* is used in
    fstab, translate '/' characters to their hex value to be sure to find the
    symlink in /dev/disk/by-label/; modify unlock_logical_volume() and
    is_encrypted() to call it.
  * Add support for LVM 'global_filter' variable in lockfs.sh: modify
    initialize_lvm_conf() and blacklist_bilibop_devices(); so 'global_filter'
    is unconditionally set to the same value than 'filter'.
  * Modify local-bottom initramfs script: when calling 'is_removable()', don't
    call 'physical_hard_disk()' again, as BILIBOP_DISK has already been
    computed.
  * Replace all occurences of '\s' by the POSIX class '[[:blank:]]' in grep
    commands.
  * Update documentation (README.Debian, TODO, examples/bilibop.conf).

  * bilibop-udev:
  * Modify the udev rules file: rely on the 'removable' attribute to know that
    a device is a disk.
  * Replace all occurences of '\s' by the POSIX class '[[:blank:]]' in grep
    commands.

  * debian/control:
  * Update bilibop-lockfs and bilibop-rules extended descriptions.
  * Move aufs-tools from Recommends: to Suggests: for bilibop-lockfs.
  * Add udisks2 as an alternative to udisks in Recommends: for bilibop-rules.
  * Bump Standards-Version: to 3.9.5; no changes.

  * Update debian/po/templates.pot and debian/po/*.po
  * Add debian/source.lintian-overrides (newer-standards-version 3.9.5), as
    lintian (2.5.19) is not yet updated (see #729096).
  * Add debian/bilibop-rules.lintian-overrides (unused-debconf-template): the
    postinst script embeds the ${HELPER} variable in template names.

bilibop (0.4.19) unstable; urgency=high

  * bilibop-lockfs:
    - Modify parse_and_modify_fstab() in lockfs.sh: skip 'rbind' mounts as
      well as 'bind' mounts.
    - Modify lockfs_mount_helper script: set -e.
    - Simplify lockfs_mount_helper; especially, rewrite the mount_fallback()
      function to parse the arguments provided by the parent process (mount)
      'as is', and do not 'exec mount', but just 'mount' instead, to be able
      to exit with a code != 0 when mount_fallback() is called.
    - Modify lockfs_mount_helper and the local-bottom initramfs script to
      parse options (BILIBOP_LOCKFS_SIZE and boot commandline) and set the
      size of the tmpfs in a better and more reliable way (use regex instead
      of glob patterns).
    - Add new function 'is_write_protected()' in lockfs.sh (takes into account
      sd, mmcblk and mspblk devices) and call it from the local-bottom
      initramfs script.
    - Modify init-top initramfs script: in the case any drive is physically
      locked, override BILIBOP_LOCKFS and BILIBOP_LOCKFS_POLICY.

  * bilibop-rules:
    Fix a bug in lsbilibop: since udev is now a part of systemd, 'udevadm info
    --root' no more works to query the udev_root value; so query it directly
    from udev.conf instead. (Closes: #727682)

bilibop (0.4.18) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add japanese translation for the debconf templates; thanks to
    <victory.deb@gmail.com> (closes: #726975).
  * debian/copyright: fix my name also here.

bilibop (0.4.17) unstable; urgency=low

  * bilibop-lockfs: modify local-bottom initramfs script and
    lockfs_mount_helper to override configuration variables and even boot
    parameters when the drive is physically locked (write protected by a
    switch).
  * bilibop-rules: fix typos in debconf templates; update po files.
  * debian/control: fix my name, and remove "Uploaders:" field.

 -- Yann Amar <quidame@poivron.org>  Fri, 11 Oct 2013 00:30:15 +0000

bilibop (0.4.16) unstable; urgency=low

  * bilibop-rules: move db_reset and db_fset commands from config to postinst
    script; this should improve the behavior of the scripts during package
    upgrade if a custom rules file has been built manually. Add comments.
  * debian/substvars: remove trailing ${Newline} in the "Description"
    variable. It had been added to work around bug #659814 (dpkg-dev),
    which has been recently fixed.

 -- bilibop project <quidame@poivron.org>  Tue, 17 Sep 2013 11:46:55 +0000

bilibop (0.4.15) unstable; urgency=low

  * bilibop-rules: modify bilibop-rules.bilibop.udev to avoid direct access
    (with blkid -p) to suspended dm devices; then create the symlink (as
    mapper/dm_name) earlier; update bilibop_rules_generator for consistency.

 -- bilibop project <quidame@poivron.org>  Fri, 09 Aug 2013 20:19:40 +0200

bilibop (0.4.14) unstable; urgency=low

  * bilibop-common: fix spelling errors in manpages.
  * bilibop-rules:
    - Modify postrm script: fix an error about udev tags directory path.
    - Include missing 'rlvm' sample script in the package.
    - Modify 'rlvm' sample (rely on $SHELL environment variable).

 -- bilibop project <quidame@poivron.org>  Sat, 20 Jul 2013 00:28:48 +0200

bilibop (0.4.13) unstable; urgency=low

  * bilibop-common: update bilibop.conf(5) manual pages.

  * bilibop-rules:
    - Modify maintainer scripts: fix syntax errors; keep variable names
      consistency between scripts; backup GRUB device.map in postinst, and
      restore it in postrm (purge); do not create a fake device.map in prerm,
      just a broken symlink.
    - Add a sample script (in the doc) to ease the use of the
      physical_volumes_filter helper script.
    - Update README.Debian
    - Remove the TODO

 -- bilibop project <quidame@poivron.org>  Thu, 04 Jul 2013 15:17:21 +0200

bilibop (0.4.12) experimental; urgency=low

  * bilibop-common:
    - Modify 'underlying_device_from_aufs()'; take into account that an aufs
      branch is not necessarly the mountpoint of a device.
    - Update the copyright date of the shell library (common.sh).
    - Update main function's dependency tree in common.sh
    - Fix a typo in the french bilibop.conf manpage.
    - Update README.Debian

  * bilibop-lockfs:
    - In the local-bottom initramfs script, follow
      BILIBOP_LOCKFS_NOTIFY_POLICY to display non-error messages in plymouth.
    - debian/control: add plymouth in the 'Suggests:' field.

  * bilibop-rules:
    - Modify bilibop_rules_generator to ease the build of rules that can be
      applied to dual port devices (especially USB and MMC/MSP/SD).
    - Modify sysfs_attrs_rule() in bilibop_rules_generator: replace occurences
      of double quotes (") by a question mark (?) in values of attributes (as
      " means inch) instead of removing these attributes.
    - Modify make_unpersistent_rules and the initramfs script to fix a design
      error in the 'unpersistent rules' feature. This mainly affected the cd
      rules (symlinks to /dev/sr* were not always created or updated).
    - Make the package debconf-configurable: rewrite existing maintscripts;
      add bilibop-rules.config and bilibop-rules.templates; add debian/po/
      and populate it; modify debian/control and debian/rules.
    - Add french translation for debconf.
    - Update README.Debian

  * bilibop-udev:
    - Modify postinst script: if the disk hosting the system (or one of its
      partitions) still belong to 'floppy' group, then exit with error, unless
      a custom rules file exists.
    - modify postrm script: be sure /sys/block exists before doing things; use
      ERE instead of BRE in grep commands.
    - Update README.Debian

  * debian/control: update Homepage: and Vcs-Git: fields.
  * debian/copyright: remove the 'Source: ' field and update copyright dates.
  * debian/substvars: replace the strict requirement by something more soft,
    as an advice.

bilibop (0.4.11) experimental; urgency=low

  * bilibop-common: modify /lib/bilibop/test to output the value of
    BILIBOP_COMMON_BASENAME, unless the -q option is used.
  * bilibop-udev:
    - Modify the udev rules file to create a symlink with the output of
      /lib/bilibop/test.
    - Rewrite postinst script to not fail when the package is installed in a
      chrooted or debootstraped environment, and explicitly load the udev
      rules before triggering uevents.
  * bilibop-rules: fix an error (typo) about -x option in the
    physical_volumes_filter script.

bilibop (0.4.10) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/compat: bump to compatibility level 9.
  * debian/control: down libnotify-bin from Recommends: to Suggests: for the
    bilibop-lockfs binary package.

  * bilibop-common: modify is_aufs_mountpoint() and physical_hard_disk(): set
    some local variables to an empty string to fix shell-dependant behaviours
    with the 'local' built-in command.

  * bilibop-rules:
    - Modify helper scripts in /usr/share/bilibop: set -e; reformat syntax
      (spaces, neawlines, indents); fix minor errors and cosmetics.
    - make_unpersistent_rules: replace the --skip option by the more explicit
      --only; remove the confusing --reverse option; allow to always handle
      the two files in the same command line.
    - bilibop_rules_generator: fix printf errors and output redirection, and
      manage minor failures to not abort immediately.
    - grub_device_map_manager: add link_device_map() function; do not
      automatically and stupidly remove the existing devive map when the
      --link option is used; fix typos.
    - lsbilibop: add -l option to not rely on BILIBOP udev tags; query the
      ID_DRIVE_DETACHABE value.
    - Update documentation.

  * bilibop-udev: add a new udev rule (to create a 'bootdisk' symlink).

bilibop (0.4.9) experimental; urgency=low

  * bilibop-rules: modify debian/bilibop-rules.bilibop-udev and
    bilibop_rules_generator to unconditionally set UDISKS_SYSTEM_INTERNAL to 1
    for the main drive.
  * bilibop-lockfs: add 'activate_bilibop_lv()' in lockfs.sh functions, and
    call it from bilibop-lockfs local-bottom initramfs script. This is needed
    to be sure all Logical Volumes needed by the system (listed in /etc/fstab
    and/or /etc/crypttab) are active at this step.
  * Fix typos: replace all occurences of \' by \(aq in manual pages.

bilibop (0.4.7) experimental; urgency=low

  * bilibop-udev: fix a bux in the udev rules (a matching rule as
    KERNEL=="$result*" is not supported by udev).
  * bilibop-common: add /lib/bilibop/test (to be used by new bilibop-udev udev
    rule); as the 'proof of concept' /lib/bilibop/disk is no more needed by
    bilibop-udev, modify it to output the full path of the disk.
  * debian/control: move versioned dependency on initscripts from bilibop-common
    to bilibop-lockfs and bilibop-rules.
  * Remove debian/source.lintian-overrides (current version of the Debian policy
    is now 3.9.4).

bilibop (0.4.6) experimental; urgency=low

  * bilibop-lockfs:
    - Add support for plymouth: send a message from local-bottom initramfs
      script when bilibop-lockfs is enabled, disabled or has failed.
    - Allow to override/blank BILIBOP_LOCKFS_WHITELIST with 'lockfs=all'
      boot parameter.
    - Update documentation.

  * bilibop-rules:
    - Add a new helper script: physical_volumes_filter, and its shell
      functions: pvfilter.sh; the script is used to modify the variables
      'obtain_device_list_from_udev' and 'filter' in lvm.conf.
    - Rewrite udev rules and bilibop_rules_generator to tag internal drives
      and partitions, and restore some dm-* related symlinks in the udev
      database (needed by the new script).
    - Update documentation.

  * debian/control: update bilibop-rules extended description.
  * Rewrite maintainer scripts.

bilibop (0.4.5) experimental; urgency=low

  * bilibop-lockfs: modify bilibop-lockfs initramfs scripts, lockfs.sh and
    lockfs_mount_helper:
    - 'noswap' boot parameter overrides BILIBOP_LOCKFS_SWAP_POLICY and set
      it to "hard".
    - parse /proc/cmdline in a more portable and robust way: take into account
      that the last runlevel (0 to 6, S and single) overrides all the previous
      ones; allow the general format 'lockfs[=opt1[,opt2[,opt3]]]' with
      options 'hard', 'soft', 'force' and an arbitrary string matching a regex
      for the size of the tmpfs used for /.
  * Update bilibop-lockfs documentation (README.Debian).
  * Update bilibop.conf(5) manual page for bilibop-lockfs related variables
    that can be overridden from boot commandline.

bilibop (0.4.4) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fix inconsistent variable name in the lockfs_mount_helper script.
  * Modify lockfs_mount_helper script: allow devices with 'crypto'
    ID_FS_USAGE (instead of only 'filesystem') to be listed in the
    BILIBOP_LOCKFS_WHITELIST variable.
  * Update bilibop.conf(5) manual pages (en & fr), and fix a translation
    error in the french version.

bilibop (0.4.3) experimental; urgency=low

  * bilibop-common:
    - Add lib/bilibop/disk (outputs the name of the disk hosting the root
      filesystem, or hosting a file, device or directory given as argument);
    - Update documentation (README.Debian and bugs.txt).
  * bilibop-lockfs:
    - Fix error due to invalid lvm.conf settings (read_only_volume_list should
      not be set if empty): modify 'bilibop-lockfs' initramfs scripts, and
      the functions 'parse_and_modify_fstab()', 'initialize_lvm_conf()',
      'blacklist_bilibop_devices()', 'set_readonly_lvm_settings()' and
      'unlock_logical_volume()'.
    - Improve support for loop devices (take into account that the first field
      in fstab can be a regular file instead of a block device): modify
      lockfs_mount_helper script and 'parse_and_modify_fstab()' function in
      lockfs.sh.
  * bilibop-udev: modify udev rules file (now based on lib/bilibop/disk; runs
    faster). Add postinst and postrm maintscripts to trigger spurious uevents.
    Update README.Debian.

  * debian/control: change Section of bilibop binary package (from misc to
    metapackages); change Depends of the same package (replace dependency on
    bilibop-device-policy virtual package by a versioned dependency on
    bilibop-rules).

bilibop (0.4.1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Modify lockfs.sh:
    - add new functions: 'set_readonly_lvm_settings()', to modify
      'locking_type', 'metadata_read_only' and 'read_only_volume_list'; and
      'unlock_logical_volume()', to not lock (set read-only) whitelisted
      Logical Volumes.
    - rewrite 'initialize_lvm_conf()' to also initialize 'locking_type',
      'metadata_read_only' and 'read_only_volume_list' LVM variables.
    - rewrite 'blacklist_bilibop_devices()'.
    - modify 'parse_and_modify_fstab()' to use 'unlock_logical_volumes()'.
  * bilibop-lockfs:
    - modify local-bottom initramfs script (call 'set_readonly_lvm_settings()'
      when lockfs policy is 'hard').
    - modify initramfs hook to include a list of Logical Volumes in the
      initramdisk; this list is used by 'set_readonly_lvm_settings()'.
    - new init-top initramfs script, to call 'set_readonly_lvm_settings()'
      very early in the boot process, unless the 'nolockfs' parameter is used
      in the boot commandline.
  * Update documentation (debian/bilibop-lockfs.README.Debian).
  * Modify lockfs-notify script: replace 'permanent' by 'persistent' and
    'temporary' by 'volatile'.

  * Modify bilibop.conf(5) manual pages: use the '.SS' tag, and replace \' by
    \(aq.

  * debian/control: update bilibop-lockfs description; since bilibop depends
    on bilibop-device-policy, remove 'all' from 'install all other BILIBOP
    packages'. For bilibop-udev, replace versioned suggestion on
    bilibop-lockfs by unversioned one.

bilibop (0.4.0) experimental; urgency=low

  * Add new binary package: bilibop-udev, as a minimal subset of
    bilibop-rules. There is a conflict between bilibop-udev and bilibop-rules,
    and each of them provides the 'bilibop-device-policy' virtual package.
  * bilibop-lockfs: the mount_fallback() function being the only one in
    lockfs.sh that can be used by the lockfs_mount_helper script, move it from
    lockfs.sh to lockfs_mount_helper, and source common.sh directly instead of
    lockfs.sh from lockfs_mount_helper.
  * bilibop-common: update documentation:
    - add a reference to bilibop-udev in misc/udev.txt
    - update misc/bugs.txt (new bug reported against udisks)
    - give additional information about encrypted swap devices (misc/swap.txt)
    - add a NOTE about hibernation, and explain how to hide the 'hibernate'
      button of xfce4-session-logout (misc/swap.txt)
    - give more info about the LVM 'filter' settings and how to use it from OS
      on external media (misc/lvm2.txt)
    - give detailed info on how to build and use non-default keymap in GRUB
      (misc/grub2.txt)

  * debian/changelog: fix a debchangelog syntax error in the Initial Release
    entry (add the missing colon after 'Closes').
  * debian/control: update dependency relationships and description of the
    binary packages:
    - bilibop: modify the Depends: field; now bilibop depends on the virtual
      package 'bilibop-device-policy' instead of 'bilibop-rules (= version)'.
    - bilibop-common: modify the Suggests: field; now suggests the virtual
      package 'bilibop-device-policy' as above and remove (= version) for
      bilibop-lockfs.
    - bilibop-lockfs: modify the Recommends: and Suggests: fields in the same
      manner. Move 'aufs-tools' and 'libnotify-bin' from Suggests: to
      Recommends: field. Add some details in the long description.
    - bilibop-rules: add 'grub-common' and 'lvm2' in Recommends: and move
      'udisks' from Suggests: to Recommends: field. Update short description.
      Add some details in the long description.

bilibop (0.3.6) experimental; urgency=low

  * bilibop-common: modify common.sh for portability:
    - device_node_from_major_minor(): replace local path= by dev= (path is
      an environment variable of zsh, as PATH, but with spaces as separators
      instead of colons).
    - underlying_device_from_aufs(): escape equal sign (\=) in a variable
      subtitution (for compatibility with zsh again).
  * bilibop-common: modify common.sh to be sure DEBUG is 'true' or 'false'.
  * bilibop-common: modify physical_hard_disk(). Base the loop on /sys/block/*
    instead of the content of /proc/partitions. Runs a little bit faster.
  * bilibop-common: Add support for aufs module parameter 'brs=0'; add
    aufs_dirs_if_brs0() function, and modify aufs_readonly_branch(),
    aufs_writable_branch() and aufs_dirs() to use the new one.
  * bilibop-common: modify _drivemap_volume_size() to use 10 instead of 8 as a
    limit to display sizes in MB).
  * bilibop-common: add FSF address in the licence header of common.sh

  * bilibop-lockfs: use device_nodes() in blacklist_bilibop_devices().
  * bilibop-rules: fix typo in lsbilibop(8) french manual page.

  * Update documentation for bilibop-common (README.Debian, bugs.txt and
    lvm2.txt), bilibop-lockfs (README.Debian) and bilibop-rules
    (README.Debian).

  * debian/control: replace debhelper (>= 9.0.0) by debhelper (>= 9) in the
    Build-Depends: field. Add "GNU/Linux" in the short description of the
    bilibop metapackage.
  * debian/substvars: replace 'Debian' by 'Debian GNU/Linux'; add 'eSATA' in
    the list of external media.

bilibop (0.3.5) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fix typos in manpages and add french translations of the manpages.

  * bilibop-rules:
    Remove loopback udev rules file and modify bilibop rules file and
    bilibop_rules_generator to not depend on the BACKING_FILE variable.

  * bilibop-rules:
    Rewrite lsbilibop to allow to trigger uevents in a per-action and
    per-device basis: split -u option (update) to -a (action=add) and -c
    (action=change) options.
    Add a short help message in the case BILIBOP udev tag does not exist.
    Add the DEVLINKS udev property in the info (-i option) output.
    Relative paths, symlinks and wildcards are now supported in the
    commandline.

  * bilibop-rules:
    Modify lsbilibop manpage to be consistent with the new lsbilibop script.

  * bilibop-lockfs:
    Be less restrictive in blacklist_bilibop_devices() when building the
    'reject' patterns for lvm.conf filter array: only apply on bilibop
    Physical Volumes and their symlinks instead of all bilibop block
    devices and parent directories of their symlinks.
    Modify and rename overwrite_lvm_conf() to initialize_lvm_conf().
    Add BILIBOP_PART variable in the initramfs script.

  * bilibop-common:
    Fix drivemap output errors: remove annoying trailing spaces, fix width
    issues that occured with the -p option.
    Define the PROG variable and replace all occurencies of ${0##*/} by ${PROG}
    Fix a missing redirection to stderr when --debug is invoked.

  * bilibop-common:
    add device_nodes() function, which is used now in physical_hard_disk() and
    in lsbilibop script. Fix indentations (expand tabs) in common.sh.

  * bilibop-common:
    Add Copyright and Licence as header of lib/bilibop/common.sh, which can be
    used standalone.

  * debian/control: fix typo in bilibop-common description.
  * Remove unneeded executable bit of maintainer scripts and file intended to
    be installed in /bin and /usr/bin.
  * Add debian/source.lintian-overrides to override lintian warning message
    W: bilibop source: newer-standards-version 3.9.4 (current is 3.9.3)

bilibop (0.3.4) experimental; urgency=low

  * debian/control: bump Standards-Version to 3.9.4; add dependency on
    initscripts (>= 2.88dfs-13.3) for bilibop-common. Replace versioned
    dependencies on udev and initramfs-tools by unversioned dependencies;
    remove versioned dependency on base-files. Replace Vcs-Browser: field
    by Vcs-Git: field.
  * lib/bilibop/common.sh: add a test in physical_hard_disk() to avoid
    possible failures with some partition schemes. Allow
    parent_device_from_dm() to accept a device basename or its absolute path
    as argument.
  * lib/bilibop/lockfs.sh: allow is_encrypted() to treat devices called by
    their UUID or LABEL as well as their filename.

bilibop (0.3.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: in the Suggests: field of bilibop-rules, replace the too
    specific 'grub2' by a list of alternatives (grub-coreboot, grub-efi-amd64,
    grub-efi-ia32, grub-ieee1275 and grub-pc).

  * Add a TODO in bilibop-common, bilibop-rules and bilibop-lockfs.
  * Include /etc/bilibop/bilibop.conf in the bilibop-common binary package.
  * Modify scripts and documentation to take into account that there can be
    more than height loopback devices.

  * bilibop-rules:
    - Fix errors on tests in the initramfs script.
    - Modify grub_device_map_manager to exit with code 0.
  * bilibop-rules.postinst: trigger uevents for block devices.

bilibop (0.3.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control:
    - Update Build-depends from debhelper (>= 8.0.0) to debhelper (>= 9.0.0).
    - Change some dependencies of binary packages to versioned dependencies:
      udev (>= 167), initramfs-tools (>= 0.99). As for base-files (>= 6.4),
      this is needed by the use of the /run temporary directory in bilibop
      functions or scripts.

  * bilibop-lockfs: modify the initramfs hook: busybox providing its own
    blockdev builtin, don't add /sbin/blockdev in the initramfs if busybox is
    added.
  * extended_partition(): rewrite to avoid direct access on devices (now
    based on udev instead of blkid), move it from lockfs.sh to common.sh
  * lockdev_rootdev_tree():
    - Rewrite it to avoid direct access on devices.
    - Rename it blockdev_root_subtree().
  * lockfs_mount_helper:
    - When the fstype registered in /etc/fstab is 'crypt', 'crypt_LUKS' or
      'crypto_LUKS', set the mounted mapped device as readonly too (and not
      only the underlying device) if asked by BILIBOP_LOCKFS_POLICY != soft.
    - Use LC_ALL=C before the verbose chmod and chown to not depend on the
      locale and simplify the regexp in sed.
  * Put the loop used in the initramfs script to parse and modify fstab in the
    parse_and_modify_fstab() function in lockfs.sh, and call this function in
    the initramfs script.
  * Because LVM tools can bypass 'readonly' settings of block devices and
    reset them as writable, add new functions in lockfs.sh:
    - blacklist_bilibop_devices(): called from the initramfs script.
    - overwrite_lvm_conf(): called from the previous one.
    They are used to disallow management of bilibop (physical and virtual)
    devices by the lvm commands by filtering them in the temporary lvm.conf.
    This avoids breakage of bilibop-lockfs 'hard' policy, at least for the
    root filesystem and its parent devices.
  * Add a new part (3.1.g) in README.Debian to explain what is done, and why.

  * bilibop-common: add a reference to
    http://wiki.debian.org/AdvancedStartupShutdownWithMultilayeredBlockDevices
    in the documentation.
  * Add misc/bugs.txt and misc/lvm2.txt in the documentation.
  * common.sh: remove unneeded command substitution (echo) in the
    undelying_device_from_loop() function.
  * New available options in usr/bin/drivemap:
    - Split --debug to --debug and -x or --set-x
    - Add -p or --mountpoint to explicitly ask to display mountpoints.
    - Add -w or --width to control the width of the output.
  * drivemap.sh: modify _dotline() and _print_line() to include new options.
  * drivemap.1: add the new options in the manpage.
  * _drivemap_primary_partitions(): rewrite to use extended_partition().

  * Fix some typos, unclear sentences and language errors in debian/control,
    in the documentation and in the comments of scripts and functions.

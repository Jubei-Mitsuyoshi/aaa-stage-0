`kernel' and `Linux/*' load drivers, set up hardware, read the hardware clock
etc. using only the root filesystem and without requiring write access.

`root' checks the root filesystem before mounting it read/write.

`fs' checks and mounts all local and remote filesystems (and removes
/etc/nologin).

`networking' configures all network interfaces and passes some related settings
to the kernel.

`console' simply spawns a `getty' for root on VT 1.  It has no dependencies.
`tty' starts the terminal processes.  You may want to edit `tty' to add your own
`getty's.

`xdm', `syslog', `cron', `atd', `acpi', `fam', `gpm' and `portmap' are your
favorite daemons.

All these scripts are not very verbose.  The idea is that the user should be
notified only when things go wrong.
